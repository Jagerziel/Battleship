# Battleship

## Description
Battleship is a game of naval dominance.  Each player starts with 5 ships and the rules are simple: 
- Ships are placed randomly on the board
- Each player takes turns targeting a sqaure in the hopes of hitting an enemy ship.  The goal is to sink all enemy ships 
- Once a player sinks all 5 ships, the game ends and that player is declared the winner!
